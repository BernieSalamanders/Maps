		        <h4>Located between 130-138 Astor Drive in Rhinebeck, NY.</h4>
<p>The Gardens Trail easement was obtained by Winnakee Land Trust in January of 2005 and has since been established as a public access trail. This full, half mile loop is ideal for hikers of all skill levels .&nbsp;Stop by for a quick hike and be sure to look for the parking lot. Winnakee will be establishing a trail kiosk at the site in 2016.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="http://troop128rhinebeck.info/" target="_blank">Boy Scout Troop 128</a> for helping us prepare the trail for winter!</p>
